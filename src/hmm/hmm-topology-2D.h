// The following would be the text form for the "normal" HMM topology.
// Note that the first state is the start state, and the final state,
// which must have no output transitions and must be nonemitting, has
// an exit probability of one (no other state can have nonzero exit
// probability; you can treat the transition probability to the final
// state as an exit probability).
// Note also that it's valid to omit the "<PdfClass>" entry of the <State>, which
// will mean we won't have a pdf on that state [non-emitting state].  This is equivalent
// to setting the <PdfClass> to -1.  We do this normally just for the final state.
// The Topology object can have multiple <TopologyEntry> blocks.
// This is useful if there are multiple types of topology in the system.

// we decided to accumulate the stats.  Any transitions arising from (*)
// HMM states with "kNoPdf" as the label are second-class transitions,
// They do not have "transition-states" or "transition-ids" associated
// with them.  They are used to create the FST version of the
// HMMs, where they lead to epsilon arcs.
// (*) "arising from" is a bit of a technical term here, due to the way
// (if reorder == true), we put the transition-id associated with the
// outward arcs of the state, on the input transition to the state.
